Tharsis-full contains various code needed to start a project using Tharsis, unlike
Tharsis-core which only contains the "bare metal" core.

If you plan on using Tharsis, your project should probably depend on Tharsis-full; only
use bare Tharsis-core if you know what you're doing, e.g. if you want to implement your
own Source to load entities from instead of using YAML and absolutely need to avoid
Tharsis-full's dependencies such as D:YAML.


**NOTE**: This project is in early development and not useful unless you know what you're
doing.
